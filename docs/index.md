## About

KringleCraft.com is an online CTF solution editor and report generator inspired by the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge & KringleCon. 
The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge takes place every year during the Christmas holiday season and offers a lot of challenges, knowledge, fun and interaction with other players.
You can even write a report with your solutions and win valuable prizes.  
In 2021, I created a report in Markdown format (Markdown is the ideal format for documentation, in my opinion, as it is easy to learn and use and offers syntax highlighting out of the box).
I invested a lot of time to create a nice and well-structured report, so I had the idea to automate the whole thing.   
By 2022, I had simple Python scripts that prepared the data for me as a report.  
I continued to work on it from late 2023 to mid-2024, and now I have a solution written in Python using the Flask and Bootstrap frameworks. 
The data is stored in an SQLite database and additional files, such as images, are stored in the local file system. 
This makes the application very portable and can run on any operating system with minimal dependencies.  
It can be used directly on a client, and in combination with a web server (e.g., Apache) as a proxy and the WSGI middleware, it can also be easily made available on the Internet.  
My platform is, of course, inspired by Kringle Con, but is flexible enough to be used for any CTF scenario.   
The environment available at [KringleCraft.com](https://www.kringlecraft.com) contains my reports for 2021, 2022 and 2023.
