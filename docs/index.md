## About

KringleCraft.com is an online CTF solution editor and report generator inspired by SANS Holiday Hack Challenge & KringleCon. The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge takes place every year at Christmastime and offers lots of challenges, knowledge, fun and exchange with other players.  You can even write a report with your solutions and win valuable prizes.  
In 2021, I created a report in Markdown format (Markdown is the ideal format for documentation in my opinion, as it is easy to learn and use and offers syntax highlighting). I invested a lot of time to create a nice and well-structured report, so I had the idea to automate the whole thing.   
In 2022, I then had simple Python scripts that prepared the data for me as a report.  
I continued working on it at the end of 2023, and now I have a self-hosted solution written in Python in combination with Flask and Bootstrap, which stores the data in a Postgresql database and files, images, etc. in an S3 bucket.   
My platform is of course inspired by Kringle Con, but is flexible enough to be used for any CTF scenario.   
I also imported my old reports from 2021 and 2022.
